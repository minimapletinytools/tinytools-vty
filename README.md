# tinytools-vty

`tinytools-vty` is a mono-space text diagram editor written in Haskell. It is currently a WIP and expect to have an beta release SOON.

This repository contains the vty based view implementation built on top of the [tiny-tools](https://github.com/pdlla/potato-illustrator) model.

# runninng

You can try out potato-illustrator already. Several features are incomplete or missing.

Once you have stack installed, just run `stack run`. You may need to manually pull the potato_flow subrepo.
